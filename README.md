# fluttercouch

With Fluttercouch is possible to use Couchbase Mobile Native SDK in Flutter Projects.

## Roadmap
The first goal is to implement all software parts needed to run the starter code listed <a href="https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite/java.html">here</a> in Flutter.

The aim is to construct a "zero-documentation" plugin that can be used by simply following the Couchbase Mobile Documentation for other platform. Therefore, any adaptation to the Flutter style has to be optional althought strongly desirable, such as integration with Inherited Widgets or other Flutter plugins that manage data and model layers.

The FlutterCouch plugin is still under development and any contribution is welcome.
